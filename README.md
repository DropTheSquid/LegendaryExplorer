ME3Explorer is a fan-made modding toolkit for _Mass Effect 3_ on the PC. It has limited support for both _Mass Effect_ and _Mass Effect 2_. ME3Explorer does not support Mass Effect games on any other platforms.

This fork is updated by ME3Tweaks and contains bleeding edge features for developers. Development is done on the [beta branch](https://github.com/Mgamerz/ME3Explorer/tree/Beta), and releases are merged into the [master](https://github.com/Mgamerz/ME3Explorer/tree/master) branch. This fork is not affiliated with the upstream version of ME3Explorer and is the only actively maintained version of the toolset.

## Features
All stable releases starting with 3.0.7.0 on this fork are signed with the ME3Tweaks code signing certificate.

Some highlights of features that were developed on this fork:
 - Jumplists in the taskbar allow you to right click to open tools
 - Many quality of life improvements in the UI, such as pressing enter to submit, opening files in other tools directly from tools themselves, smart recents menus
 - Package Editor has property relinking when drag/dropping between files for the entire tree. This saves a HUGE amount of time for users compared to the old manual way.
 - You can view Bio2DA tables natively in Bio2DA editor view in Package Editor.
 - You can edit levels using Pathfinding Editor, including placement of objects, pathfinding, and spline movement and recalculation of reparam tables
 - WPF rewrites of multiple tools to use a more modern design language - better DPI scaling, more features. These include PackageEditorWPF (and its contents), and SoundplorerWPF, with more on the way. All of these tools are being completely rewritten.
 - Many more not listed here
  
You can get these releases in Mass Effect 3 Mod Manager from the tools menu, or you can download from the releases tab above. Come to the ME3Tweaks Discord to talk with the developers.
